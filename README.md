**Project Description: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (Windows Forms Application)**

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using C# and Windows Forms. The game features a user interface (UI) that allows the player to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and then competes against the computer. The computer's choice is generated randomly.

**Key Features:**

**User Interaction:**
The user can select one of three choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking corresponding buttons.
**Game Logic:**
The game compares the player's choice against the computer's randomly generated choice. The result is determined by the classic rules of the game:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
The game displays the outcome (Win, Loss, or Tie) along with both the user's and the computer's choices.
**UI Feedback:**
The background color of the UI changes based on the result of the round:
Green for a user win
Red for a computer win
Yellow for a tie
**Score Tracking:**
The game tracks and displays the number of wins for both the user and the computer, updating the score after each round.
**Technologies Used:**

**C# Programming Language:** Core logic of the game and interaction.
**Windows Forms (WinForms):** For creating the graphical user interface (UI), including buttons, labels, and feedback colors.
**Random Number Generation:** Used to simulate the computer's choice by randomly selecting between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.


This project is a basic demonstration of event-driven programming in C#, with the focus on creating an interactive game with visual feedback. The game uses common programming concepts such as conditionals, random number generation, and event handling in a Windows Forms environment.
